Udemy Blazor Tutorial by Brhugen Patel. I did not create this!!!

## Introduction
This is a fantastic project by Mr. Patel. It has a client application, a seller-focused inventory application (https://tangywebserver11.azurewebsites.net), and an API (https://tangywebapi11.azurewebsites.net/index.html)

## Technology
This application uses ASP.NET Blazor for both front and backend. A few plugins like toastr, sweetalerts, sendgrid, were used for some details.
